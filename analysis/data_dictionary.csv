I do not have the experience that employers may want yet so I hope that my graduate degree will compensate at least a little bit for that lack of experience. After getting my undergraduate in 2020 I became pregnant and had 3 children with my husband by 2023, and I chose to care for my children because they were my priority in that time. So those years put me behind, I feel, the sense of my professional world. Attending graduate school to me is worth the cost of gaining knowledge and being able to share the credential with future employers. | I think the cost is very reasonable. I compared programs and this program was one of the least expensive options. | When deciding to attend graduate school, I had to weigh both the financial costs and the long-term career benefits. On the cost side, tuition was the most obvious factor. I knew that completing a master’s program would require a meaningful financial investment, especially when combined with textbooks, fees, and other academic expenses. | The cost of 15K for the graduate degree I take as a sunk but necessary cost. This degree will allow me to avoid a lot of additional work required by the state for different certification licensures | I took out loans for grad school because the cost-benefit of having the degree would pay off in the long run. | The finances are definitely stressful. CPAs seem to make good money, but not doctor money or anything. I was very reluctantly applying to a MAcc that was going to cost north of 30k, so TAMUCC's advertised $15k was very appealing to me. | I expect a graduate degree to increase my earning potential and accelerate career advancement, since many leadership roles in accounting require a master's degree. I see this as an investment in my future. In the long run, I think that the benefits will outweigh the cost. | Advanced education strengthens my qualifications for leadership and specialized positions. | I started this purley to get my CPA but honestly thinking about not continuing it and moving on the CPA prep | I evaluated the tuition cost and time commitment alongside the long-term benefits of higher earning potential, stronger technical skills, and increased career opportunities. Although it required sacrifice, I ultimately viewed graduate school as a valuable investment in my future. | I did not plan on completing my graduate degree without some kind of financial assistance. I got started with the hopes of qualifying for a scholarship along the way. This semester I decided to take out more loans in order to cover the cost and miraculously qualified for a scholarship at the same time.

I'm sure working long enough would absolutely make up for that, but I think there's a place for book learning in a field like accounting. | I still think that a master's degree should be required to be better prepared for the CPA exam and the type of work you will perform after obtaining your license.

Q56,"Please explain how you have personally thought about the costs and benefits (e.g., tuition, lost income, expected salary, future promotions) of attending graduate school.",text,"I’ve thought about graduate school many times, but the main thing that stops me is the cost. I come from a low-income family, so I wouldn’t have any help paying for it. Taking out loans would mean putting myself in debt that could take years to pay off, and that’s a huge weight to think about.
I’ve also looked at the benefits. I know graduate school can lead to higher pay or better job opportunities, but those benefits usually don’t show up right away. From what I’ve seen in my own work experience, promotions can depend on education, but they also depend a lot on experience. I’ve worked alongside people with degrees, and we often start in the same place and move up at the same pace. I’ve also seen people reach high positions without an undergraduate or graduate degree at all.
So when I compare the cost, the debt, and the time to see any payoff to where I am now and the experience I’m gaining, graduate school doesn’t feel like the right choice for me personally. | I have compared the benefits of having my Bachelors Degree to getting my Masters Degree and having my Masters Degree would greatly impact the positions I am eligible for. | I have spoke to many people that have CPA's from where I am from. The ones that have masters are making quite a bit more because many that only have undergrads do not have CPA's. I am wanting to attend grad school to also obtain more knowledge. | Since work experience can be equally valued or more valued than education depending on level of experience. | I feel like I will be able to bring in more with a masters degree so it would balance out | My parents would pay for the school and I would pay them back over time. | I have hesitance to enroll in a graduate program immediately after completing my BBA due to the costs. I would like to pay down my student loans before taking out more loans to fund a graduate degree. I do believe that having a graduate degree would provide more opportunity for me in my career, and ultimately lead to a higher salary. | In our current economy, everything has increased tremendously, making daily expenses harder and necessitating careful consideration before pursuing a higher education degree. I also know how valuable a degree is and how it can significantly impact your salary and future promotions. I have been laid off twice, and the last one affected me greatly. Even though I had 12 years of experience in the finance industry, and every job I applied for stated that you either needed a degree or 3 years of experience, I was still turned down for not having a degree. I had no choice but to start over in entry-level employment, and it has taken me 11 years to reach the same salary I had at 23. | They’re going  to be more expensive | I am not attending graduate school. | My personal thought is that my Bachelor's in accounting will be enough to provide immediately after college.

Q9,"Please share any thoughts on how the graduate program could be improved or adapted in light of potential changes to CPA licensure pathways. Consider areas such as coursework, program structure, career services, or student support services, and please be as specific as possible.",text,"Making each course more applicable to real world experiences, and not solely theoretical. I feel like a lot of textbooks are outdated and confined in possibilities. I appreciate project work more than exams, I believe it is more beneficial and tactical. | I would like to see a course added specifically for CPA preparation. | With the ongoing discussions around modernizing CPA licensure, especially the move toward more technology-focused pathways, I believe the graduate program has an opportunity to adapt in ways that better prepare students for the future of the profession | McGrawhill quizzes are generally not similar to homework’s/book reading. This is generally an area that causes students to struggle | As CPA licensure pathways continue to change, I think the graduate program could be improved by becoming more flexible and more focused on real-world experience. If states begin allowing more experience hours in place of extra coursework, it would help if the program offered structured internship or work-based learning options that count toward both degree requirements and CPA preparation. That would make the program feel more practical and aligned with what employers are asking for. | I still do not know what to expect for the CPA exam. I do not know what kinds of questions will be on the exam. I do not know what exactly I need to focus on to prepare for the different sections. | Even without a credit requirement, I think many people will choose to do graduate coursework as a CPA prep method. Making sure as many classes as possible are directly tailored to the six possible exams could be appealing to many people. Even if no significant changes need to be made to specific courses, adding some kind of note in the course description (like a bolded ""This course will help prepare students for exam AUD"" or something like that) could help students know what courses to pick to prepare for which exams, and could help make students more confident that this program and the specific courses would be helpful for their CPA prep | There should be an elective course dedicated exclusively for CPA exam preparation to make obtaining a master's degree more attractive. | Ensuring a higher pass rate would benefit. | Make classes specific to preparing people for the CPA exam | It could be improved in the graduate program by minimizing courses that wouldn’t apply to the major taken. | Strenghthen skills in areas like AI, automation, and data visualization which complement CPA preparation and make graduates more competitive.
