# RQ1 Variable Map: Factors influencing decision to pursue CPA licensure

## Primary outcome (intent to pursue CPA)
- **Selected intent variable: `Q29`** — "How likely are you to pursue a CPA license?"
  - Why this is best: it directly measures pursuit likelihood on a 5-point ordered scale from very unlikely to very likely.

### Top 3 intent candidates considered
1. `Q29` (chosen): direct likelihood to pursue CPA license.
2. `Q51`: impact of alternative pathway on desire to pursue CPA (captures *change* in intent, not baseline intent).
3. `Q6`: overall perception of pathway changes (attitude toward policy, not direct CPA-pursuit intention).

## RQ1-relevant factor fields

### Motivations / barriers / decision levers
- `Q39_1`: Importance of CPA exam preparation in graduate program value (**exam difficulty/preparation**).
- `Q55`: Belief that graduate degree increases lifetime earnings (**ROI/value**).
- `Q30`: Influence of meeting CPA licensure requirements via graduate program (**education requirement / 150-hour requirement**).
- `Q6`: Perception of alternative pathway with fewer credits + extra work year (**work experience + pathway framing**).
- `Q53`: Awareness of alternative pathway before survey (**awareness/confusion**).
- `Q49`: Employer requires/encourages graduate degree (**employer support/pressure**).

### Open-ended qualitative evidence fields
- `Q32`: Other factors influencing pursuit of graduate degree.
- `Q36`: Why likely/unlikely to pursue graduate degree with prior pathway knowledge.
- `Q38`: Why satisfied/unsatisfied with graduate degree choice.
- `Q45`: Personal cost-benefit thinking.
- `Q50`: Reasoning behind pathway perception.
- `Q56`: Cost/benefit explanation (tuition, salary, promotions).
- `Q9`: Suggestions in light of pathway changes (includes motivations/barriers context).

## Coverage check against requested concepts
- Intent/likelihood: `Q29`.
- Motivations/barriers: `Q30`, `Q39_1`, `Q6`, plus open-ended fields.
- Cost/time: primarily open-ended (`Q45`, `Q56`, `Q36`, `Q50`).
- Exam difficulty/prep: `Q39_1` + open-ended comments about CPA prep.
- Employer support: `Q49` + open-ended employment comments.
- Education requirement: `Q30` + comments referencing 150/120 credit-hours.
- Work experience requirement: `Q6` + comments referencing extra year / 2-year experience.
- Awareness/confusion: `Q53` + pathway-awareness comments.
- Perceived ROI/value: `Q55` + open-ended cost-benefit comments.

## Important limitation for RQ1
The dataset does **not** include a single explicit select-all checklist of "reasons to pursue/not pursue CPA". RQ1 factors are therefore synthesized from available Likert/ordinal and binary items plus open-ended responses.
