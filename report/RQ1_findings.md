# RQ1 Findings

## Research question
**What factors most influence a respondent's decision to pursue (or not pursue) the CPA license?**

## Results narrative (quantitative)
Analysis used completed survey responses (`Finished=1`) and ranked factor variables by **absolute Pearson correlation with CPA intent (`Q29`)**.

Top 5 factors in this dataset:

1. **Importance of CPA exam preparation (`Q39_1`)**
   - n=199, mean=4.382/5, median=5, top-2-box (Very/Extremely)=86.9%
   - Association with CPA intent: **r=0.315**
2. **Awareness of alternative pathway (`Q53`)**
   - n=145, Yes=88, No=57
   - Association with CPA intent: **r=0.260**
3. **Influence of 150-hour requirement (`Q30`)**
   - n=54, mean=3.296/5, median=3
   - Association with CPA intent: **r=0.157**
4. **Perceived lifetime-earnings ROI (`Q55`)**
   - n=144, mean=3.847/5, median=4, top-2-box (Probably/Definitely yes)=70.8%
   - Association with CPA intent: **r=0.096**
5. **Employer encouragement/requirement (`Q49`)**
   - n=54, Yes=14, No=40
   - Association with CPA intent: **r=0.025**

Interpretation in plain English: CPA-exam-prep value and pathway awareness appear most strongly linked to higher CPA intent in this sample; education-rule fit and ROI beliefs are also relevant, while direct employer pressure is comparatively weaker in this survey.

## Triangulation: Quant + Qual Support

### 1) Exam preparation / exam difficulty
- **Stat:** `Q39_1` mean=4.382, top-2-box=86.9%, r=0.315.
- **Quotes:**
  - "I would like to see a course added specifically for CPA preparation." (ResponseID: `R_3R1DTey9xSv9izD`, `Q9`)
  - "I have never been drawn to the CPA exam or taking it... my 'dream' jobs... don't necessarily need a CPA." (ResponseID: `R_1P1NtBRJQLOcTnI`, `Q50`)

### 2) Awareness / confusion about pathways
- **Stat:** `Q53` association with intent r=0.260 (n=145).
- **Quotes:**
  - "I wanted to pursue a graduate degree to obtain 150 credit hours... state changed... to 120 credit hours and 2 years of working experience." (ResponseID: `R_6EeUtxh8X1L4VGh`, `Q32`)
  - "I would be unsure if I knew the state was going to change the credit hours from 150 to 120..." (ResponseID: `R_6EeUtxh8X1L4VGh`, `Q36`)

### 3) Education requirement (150-hour pathway)
- **Stat:** `Q30` mean=3.296, r=0.157 (n=54).
- **Quotes:**
  - "...it is better to have a masters degree and a CPA licence." (ResponseID: `R_6EeUtxh8X1L4VGh`, `Q50`)
  - "...having my Masters Degree would greatly impact the positions I am eligible for." (ResponseID: `R_1l3pgIqYqAwy2sW`, `Q56`)

### 4) ROI / value
- **Stat:** `Q55` mean=3.847, top-2-box=70.8%, r=0.096.
- **Quotes:**
  - "...higher earning potential." (ResponseID: `R_6nMYSy6nJHw1oR3`, `Q32`)
  - "...book learning in a field like accounting." (ResponseID: `R_6oMWUgiATqOr1nP`, `Q50`)

### 5) Employer support / pressure
- **Stat:** `Q49` yes=25.9% (14/54), r=0.025.
- **Quotes:**
  - "I received a promotion while in graduate school..." (ResponseID: `R_5s4izd7jEMnl9xD`, `Q45`)
  - "...only if an employer pays for grad school and/or the CPA." (ResponseID: `R_6FkttbRIlUHydQk`, `Q56`)

## Limitations
- **Item coverage limitation:** no single select-all factor checklist for CPA pursue/not-pursue exists; RQ1 is inferred from available ordinal/binary items plus text.
- **Branching missingness:** several key fields have much smaller n (e.g., n=54) due skip logic.
- **Question wording:** many items are framed around graduate program value and pathway changes, not exclusively direct CPA pursuit.
- **Representativeness:** convenience sample from one survey context; likely not representative of all CPA candidates.
- **Tooling constraint in this environment:** pandas/openpyxl/matplotlib were unavailable; results were generated with pure-Python parsing/analysis for reproducibility.
